 Code and instruction for our Automation in Construction submission:**"FloorplanGAN: Vector Residential Floorplan Adversarial Generation"**.  
### Introduction  
**FloorplanGAN** is a domain specific GAN combines Vector Generator and Raster Discriminator. It aims to synthesis vector residential floorplans based on *Adversiral Generation*, *Differentiable Rendering* and *Self-Attention*, etc.

### Vector Generator
![vector generator framework](./assets/generator_framework.svg)
### Installation

1.  dependency  
```
(base)$ conda create -n floorplangan python=3.8 -y
(base)$ conda activate floorplangan
(floorplangan)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
### Dataset  
we use a publicly available dataset *RPlan* ([http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~fuxm/projects/DeepLayout/index.html](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~fuxm/projects/DeepLayout/index.html)), which contains 80k+ well annotated real residential floorplans in PNG format.  
After the filtering and vectorization (using [Pyportace](https://pypi.org/project/pypotrace/)) described in our paper, we get a training set of 17154 samples and a test set of 2000 samples, all in vector format. The preprocessed data can be download from [baiduyun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1giCKexJcZdzgi28Gg47ltw?pwd=2dqo) or [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mW3YUt_RkATQY7-Q70VpprIgeyTS2EWP/view?usp=drive_link).  
Make directory `data_FloorplanGAN` in root directory of this project, and unzip the downloaded zipfile in this folder. 
Directory structures should be like:
```
FloorplanGAN
|---data_FloorplanGAN
|   |---names
|   `---pkls
|---main.py
|---models.py
|---dataset.py
...
```

### Configuration  
modify `config.yaml` to meet your demand:
- NUM_GPUS: number of GPUs used in training.
- NUM_WORKERS: number of CPU cores used in data loading.
- BATCHSIZE: change the batchsize according to the GPU memory. 

Others are supposed to remain unchanged.

### Training from scratch
 ![steps](./assets/steps.png)
1.  Train with single GPU
```
(floorplangan)$ python main.py
``` 
2. Or multi-GPUs (e.g. 4 GPUs)
```
(floorplangan)$ torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 main.py
```
2.  Visualize the training process  
``` 
(floorplangan)$ tesorboard --logidr=runs_rplan
``` 
### Testing with pretrained model
~~Follow the instruction in [test.ipynb](FloorPlanGAN.ipynb)~~  
Coming soon...
### Evaluating with diverse metrics
